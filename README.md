Task - 1 (Voice Assistant)

Create a basic voice assistant that can perform simple tasks based on voice
commands. Implement features like responding to "Hello" and providing predefined responses,
telling the time or date, and searching the web for information based on user queries.



Features:
1. Speech Recognition:
Utilizing the SpeechRecognition library, the AI Assistant now listens to audio input from a microphone and recognizes speech using Google's speech recognition API.
2. Text-to-Speech:
The pyttsx3 library has been integrated to convert text into speech, providing a seamless interaction with the assistant.
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP):
The program incorporates the sklearn.feature_extraction.text module, featuring the TfidfVectorizer class for converting raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features.
4. Machine Learning Model:
The AI Assistant employs a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with a linear kernel to predict user intents based on their input.
5. Diverse User Interactions:
The assistant can engage in various conversations, including greetings, farewells, weather inquiries, jokes, compliments, riddles, movie and music recommendations, game suggestions, and inspirational quotes.


Task - 2 (BMI Calculator)

Create a command-line BMI calculator in Python. Prompt users for their
weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). Calculate the BMI and classify it into categories
(e.g., underweight, normal, overweight) based on predefined ranges. Display the BMI result and
category to the user.

1. BMI Calculation:
Program computes Body Mass Index (BMI) from user-input height and weight, providing a numerical measure of their relative weight.
2. Weight Status:
Determines user's weight status (underweight, healthy, or overweight) based on the calculated BMI, offering insights into overall health.
3. User Interaction:
Engages users by prompting them to input height and weight, ensuring a personalized and interactive experience.
4. Object-Oriented Design:
Utilizes an object-oriented class structure for organized code, encapsulating BMI-related functionalities and supporting ease of maintenance.
6. Readable Output:
Presents clear and readable output messages, conveying calculated BMI and weight status information for user comprehension.
